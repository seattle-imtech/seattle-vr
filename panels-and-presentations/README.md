## What We're About

Come join the Seattle Location Based VR/AR and connect with a community of people interested in virtual reality and 3D technology. Whether you are a designer, developer, gamer, hacker, researcher, artist, entrepreneur, or are just curious, this is your chance to meet like-minded people from across Seattle’s vibrant community.

There's a renaissance emerging in VR sparked by the new wave of affordable consumer VR devices. This group is focused on finding ways to make content more suitable for VR/AR for arcade and location based centers vs. home-based content, along with making VR/AR more accessible and friendly for the mass market of users and to make VR/AR more mainstream.

## What's a Design Salon?

Seattle VR and PlutoVR are hosting the Design Salon monthly meeting to provide a forum for ux professionals, designers, researchers, students and VR/AR/XR/MR enthusiasts to deeply discuss current literature, practices, research and tech from a design perspective.

We’ll focus on a number of design issues which are unique to immersive environments, but look at each one in depth and leave time for discussion. Concepts central to UX design, user research, storytelling, collaboration, cognition and related disciplines will be applied to both the hottest and the most overlooked areas vital to designing usable immersive realities. 

Bring your curiosity!

## Salon Goal

To examine how design choices affect the user experience in VR/AR/MR/XR.
